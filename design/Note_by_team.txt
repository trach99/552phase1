Simulation Environment Adjustments:
Initially Icarus Verilog was used for simulation. However, some compilation issues were encountered, which prevented successful execution.
As a result, the simulation was directly run using ModelSim, bypassing the compilation errors.
The simulation outputs have been stored in the Outputs folder for reference.

Metadata Cache Array Modifications:
A slight modification was made to the Metadata Cache Array logic to properly handle the Least Recently Used (LRU) bit for both cache ways. 
This is implemented in the file Cache_MDA_DA.v.

The first cache_word instance handles the tag and validity bits. It takes the lower 7 bits of data_in and outputs the lower 7 bits of data_out.
LRU: The second cache_word instance handles the LRU bit. It takes the highest bit of data_in and outputs the highest bit of data_out.
Control Signals: 
The wen signal controls writes for the tag and validity bits, while the lru_en signal specifically controls updates to the LRU bit.
